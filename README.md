## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution

PROPOSED SOLUTION: 

Community-Based “Agri-Companion” Network with Offline AI Hubs

Village-level AI hubs: Low-cost solar-powered kiosks installed in farmer clusters (panchayat or FPO centers). They run lightweight AI models offline and sync periodically via low-bandwidth connections.

Voice-first interface: Farmers can talk in their dialect (even without literacy) to the hub or a shared “Agri-Companion” device.

Community trainers: Local youth trained to assist farmers with the tech, building trust and bridging literacy gaps.

Farmer-to-farmer knowledge exchange: AI also curates local success stories, allowing farmers to hear “what worked in your neighbor’s field” rather than just generic scientific advice.

PROBLEMS ADDRESSED:

Language & Literacy Barrier
→ Voice-first interaction in local dialects, no need to read/write

Lack of Reliable Advisory
→ AI-based, location-specific recommendations (soil, weather, crop history)

Overuse of Chemicals & High Input Cost
→ Precise fertilizer & pest management advice → lower expenses, sustainable farming

Dependence on Shopkeepers / Guesswork
→ Farmers get trusted, science-backed + peer-validated insights directly

Limited Internet Access
→ Offline-first AI hubs work without constant connectivity

Low Trust in Technology
→ Peer learning & farm guides build farmer confidence in using the system

INNOVATION AND UNIQUENESS:

Goes beyond mobile apps → tackles literacy & connectivity gaps<br>
Community-centered design → peer trust + tech credibility<br>
Offline-first AI → resilient even in remote villages<br>
Youth empowerment through farm guides → rural jobs + tech adoption<br>
Sustainable → solar-powered, low-cost, scalable<br>

## Technical Approach

TECHNOLOGIES:

Programming Languages:

Python (AI/ML models)<br>
JavaScript (React Native & Node.js)

Frameworks:

TensorFlow Lite (AI models on device)<br>
OpenCV (image detection)<br>
FastAPI (backend APIs)

Database:

PostgreSQL (cloud)<br>
SQLite (offline)

Hardware:

Raspberry Pi 4 + Camera<br>
Solar-powered kiosks<br>
Low-cost Android phones<br>

Cloud & APIs:

AWS (model training & storage)<br>
OpenWeather API (weather)<br>
Govt. Market APIs (prices)<br>

## Feasibility and Viability

FEASIBILITY:

Technology: Lightweight AI + voice interfaces + offline mode.<br>
Operations: Local youth trained as guides; offline-first ensures reach.<br>
Finance: Low-cost kiosks + public-private partnerships

POTENTIAL CHALLENGES AND RISKS:

Low digital literacy among farmers<br>
Poor or unreliable internet connectivity<br>
Resistance to adopting new technology<br>
Hardware maintenance and durability issues<br>
Language and dialect diversity<br>
Ensuring accuracy of AI predictions

STRATEGIES:

Implement voice-first interfaces and provide on-site guidance via trained farm guide<br>
Use offline AI models with periodic low-bandwidth synchronization<br>
Demonstration plots and sharing local success stories to build trust<br>
Community ownership model and train local youth to maintain kiosks<br>
Support multiple regional dialects with text-to-speech features<br>
Continuous learning through field data collection and expert validation<br>

## Impact and Benefits

IMPACTS:

Farmers: Higher yields, lower costs, access to local knowledge<br>
Extension Officers: Easier monitoring, better insights<br>
Government & NGOs: Efficient resource use, improved food security<br>
Krishi Mitras: Skills, employment, community recognition<br>
Community & Environment: Peer learning, eco-friendly practices

BENEFITS:
Economic: 20–30% yield increase, optimized input costs.<br>
Social: Knowledge empowerment, inclusion of low-literacy farmers.<br>
Environmental: Reduced chemical use, sustainable farming practices.
